# Cognitive Grammar Network Integration Issues

This repository implements a GitHub Action to create comprehensive project management issues for integrating ReservoirPy repository functions as nodes in a distributed agentic cognitive grammar network.

## Quick Start

### Trigger the Workflow

1. **Navigate to Actions tab** in your GitHub repository
2. **Select "Cognitive Grammar Network Integration"** workflow  
3. **Click "Run workflow"**
4. **Choose phase option:**
   - `all` - Creates all 6 phases (recommended for initial setup)
   - `1-6` - Creates specific phase only

### What Gets Created

The workflow creates GitHub issues with:
- ✅ **Detailed objectives** and implementation roadmaps
- ✅ **Actionable sub-steps** with checkboxes for tracking
- ✅ **Acceptance criteria** for completion validation
- ✅ **Dependencies** and proper sequencing
- ✅ **Timeline estimates** for project planning
- ✅ **Labels** for organization (`cognitive-integration`, `phase-X`, etc.)

```

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Focus | Integration | Duration |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | **Cognitive Primitives** | ReservoirPy → Hypergraph | 4-6 weeks |
| 2 | **Attention Allocation** | ECAN + Reservoir Dynamics | 5-7 weeks |  
| 3 | **Neural-Symbolic** | ggml + ReservoirPy Bridge | 6-8 weeks |
| 4 | **Distributed Mesh** | APIs + Embodiment | 7-9 weeks |
| 5 | **Meta-Cognition** | Evolutionary Optimization | 8-10 weeks |
| 6 | **Unification** | Production Integration | 6-8 weeks |

**Total Estimated Duration**: 36-48 weeks for complete cognitive system
