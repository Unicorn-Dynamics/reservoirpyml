# Cognitive Grammar Network Integration

This directory contains the GitHub Action workflow and scripts for integrating ReservoirPy repository functions as nodes in a distributed agentic cognitive grammar network.

## Overview

The **Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network Integration** is a comprehensive 6-phase project that transforms the ReservoirPy reservoir computing library into the foundational substrate for an advanced cognitive computing system.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Cognitive Primitives & Foundational Hypergraph Encoding
- Establish atomic vocabulary and bidirectional translation between ReservoirPy primitives and AtomSpace hypergraph patterns
- Encode agent/state as hypergraph nodes/links with tensor shapes
- Create exhaustive test patterns and visualizations

### Phase 2: ECAN Attention Allocation & Resource Kernel Construction  
- Implement dynamic, ECAN-style economic attention allocation
- Integrate activation spreading with ReservoirPy reservoir dynamics
- Benchmark attention allocation across distributed agents

### Phase 3: Neural-Symbolic Synthesis via Custom ggml Kernels
- Engineer custom ggml kernels for neural-symbolic computation
- Bridge ReservoirPy neural dynamics with symbolic reasoning
- Implement gradient flow through symbolic representations

### Phase 4: Distributed Cognitive Mesh API & Embodiment Layer
- Expose the network via REST/WebSocket APIs
- Bind to Unity3D, ROS, and web agents for embodied cognition
- Enable real-time bi-directional data flow

### Phase 5: Recursive Meta-Cognition & Evolutionary Optimization
- Enable self-observation, analysis, and recursive improvement
- Implement evolutionary algorithms for ReservoirPy optimization
- Create continuous benchmarking and self-tuning systems

### Phase 6: Rigorous Testing, Documentation, and Cognitive Unification
- Achieve comprehensive integration with ReservoirPy ecosystem
- Create unified cognitive tensor field
- Establish production-ready deployment with complete documentation

## Usage

### Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab:

1. Go to **Actions** → **Cognitive Grammar Network Integration**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select which phase to create:
   - `all` - Creates all 6 phases
   - `1-6` - Creates specific phase only

### Workflow Configuration

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/cognitive-integration.yml` and:

- Runs on `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger)
- Uses Python 3.11 with PyGithub for issue creation
- Requires `issues: write` and `contents: read` permissions
- Creates issues with appropriate labels for organization

### Script Details

The main logic is in `scripts/create_cognitive_issues.py`:

- **PHASE_TEMPLATES**: Complete issue templates for all 6 phases
- **create_issue()**: Creates GitHub issues with proper labels
- **main()**: Orchestrates the issue creation process

Each issue includes:
- Detailed objectives and sub-steps
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and timeline
- Integration points with ReservoirPy

## Integration with ReservoirPy

This cognitive grammar network builds directly on ReservoirPy's capabilities:

- **Reservoir Dynamics**: Core computational substrate for cognitive processing
- **Node Architecture**: Extended to support hypergraph encoding
- **Learning Algorithms**: Enhanced with attention-driven optimization
- **Distributed Computing**: Scaled for cognitive mesh deployment

## Getting Started

1. **Trigger the workflow** to create all phase issues
2. **Review created issues** for detailed implementation plans
3. **Begin with Phase 1** for foundational infrastructure
4. **Follow dependencies** between phases for proper sequencing

## Expected Outcomes

The completed integration will provide:

- **Cognitive Primitives** encoded as hypergraph patterns
- **Economic Attention** driving reservoir learning
- **Neural-Symbolic Computation** via custom kernels  
- **Distributed Cognitive Mesh** for embodied AI
- **Recursive Self-Improvement** through evolution
- **Production System** with complete documentation

This represents a paradigm shift from traditional reservoir computing to **distributed cognitive computing** using ReservoirPy as the foundational neural substrate.
