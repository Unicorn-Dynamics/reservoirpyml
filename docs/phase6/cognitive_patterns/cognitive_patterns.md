## Emergent Properties Analysis

### Cognitive Resonance
When multiple cognitive modules operate in harmony, the system exhibits enhanced
performance beyond the sum of individual components. This is measurable through:
- Cross-module information flow metrics
- Synchronization coefficients
- Performance enhancement ratios

### Adaptive Plasticity
The system's ability to reconfigure itself based on task demands and performance
feedback. Observable through:
- Architecture modification frequency
- Parameter adaptation rates
- Performance recovery after perturbations

### Emergent Intelligence
Higher-level cognitive capabilities that emerge from the interaction of simpler
cognitive primitives. Characterized by:
- Problem-solving capability emergence
- Creative solution generation
- Transfer learning efficiency

## Pattern Detection Methods

### Statistical Analysis
- Cross-correlation analysis between modules
- Information theory measures (mutual information, entropy)
- Principal component analysis of cognitive states

### Dynamic Analysis
- Lyapunov exponent computation for stability analysis
