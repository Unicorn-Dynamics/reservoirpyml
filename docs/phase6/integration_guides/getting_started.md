# Getting Started with Phase 6 Cognitive Unification

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Install ReservoirPy with cognitive extensions
pip install reservoirpy[cognitive]

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/Unicorn-Dynamics/reservoirpyml
cd reservoirpyml
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import numpy as np
from reservoirpy.datasets import mackey_glass
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, Ridge
from reservoirpy.cognitive import UnifiedCognitiveSystem

# 1. Create data
X = mackey_glass(n_timesteps=1000)

# 2. Create cognitive-enhanced system
cognitive_system = UnifiedCognitiveSystem()

# 3. Add ReservoirPy components
reservoir = Reservoir(units=100, lr=0.3, sr=1.25, input_dim=1)
readout = Ridge(output_dim=1, ridge=1e-5)
esn = reservoir >> readout

# 4. Enhance with cognitive capabilities
enhanced_esn = cognitive_system.enhance_reservoir_network(esn)

# 5. Train and predict
enhanced_esn.fit(X[:500], X[1:501], warmup=100)
predictions = enhanced_esn.run(X[501:-1])

# 6. Monitor performance
metrics = cognitive_system.get_performance_metrics()
print(f"Cognitive enhancement improved performance by {metrics['improvement']:.1%}")
```

## Core Concepts

### Cognitive Unification
Phase 6 unifies all cognitive modules into a single, coherent system that can:
- Process information through hypergraph representations
- Allocate attention dynamically using ECAN principles
- Perform neural-symbolic reasoning via GGML kernels
- Distribute computation across cognitive mesh networks
- Self-optimize through recursive meta-cognition

### ReservoirPy Integration
Every ReservoirPy component can be enhanced with cognitive capabilities:
- **Reservoirs** gain attention-modulated dynamics
- **Readouts** incorporate symbolic reasoning
- **Models** benefit from distributed processing
- **Training** is guided by meta-cognitive optimization

### Production Readiness
Phase 6 systems are designed for production deployment with:
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Automatic error recovery and rollback
- Performance benchmarking and SLA compliance
- Scalable architecture for high-throughput scenarios

## Next Steps
1. Read the [ReservoirPy Integration Guide](reservoirpy_integration.md)
2. Explore the [API Reference](../api_reference/unified_api_reference.md)
3. Check out the [Performance Tuning Guide](performance_tuning.md)
4. Deploy to production with the [Deployment Guide](production_deployment.md)
